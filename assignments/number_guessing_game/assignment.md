# Assignment: Number Guessing Game

## Overview

Create a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. Practice using loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Instructions

- Complete the TODOs in the provided code files.
- Your program should:
  - Randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
  - Prompt the user to guess the number.
  - Give feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
  - Count the number of attempts.
  - End when the user guesses correctly.

## Files to Edit

- `main.py`: Handles the game loop and user interaction.
- `game_logic.py`: Contains functions for generating the number and checking guesses.

## Hints

- Use `random.randint(1, 100)` to generate the secret number.
- Use a `while` loop to keep asking for guesses until the user is correct.
- Use a counter variable to track the number of attempts.
- Use `if` statements to compare the guess to the secret number and give feedback.
- Print a congratulatory message when the user wins.

## Extension

Let the user choose the range for the random number.

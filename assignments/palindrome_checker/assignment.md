# Assignment: Palindrome Checker

## Overview

Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Practice using string methods, functions, and conditionals.

## Instructions

- Complete the TODOs in the provided code files.
- Your program should:
  - Prompt the user for a string.
  - Check if the string is a palindrome (ignore case and spaces).
  - Print whether it is a palindrome or not.

## Files to Edit

- `main.py`: Handles user input and output.
- `palindrome.py`: Contains the palindrome checking function.

## Hints

- Use `str.lower()` and `str.replace()` to normalize the string.
- Use slicing to reverse the string.
- Use `input()` to get the string from the user.
- Convert the string to lowercase and remove spaces.
- Use slicing (`[::-1]`) to reverse the string.
- Compare the cleaned string to its reverse.
- Use a loop to allow checking multiple strings.

## Extension

Allow the user to check multiple strings until they enter "quit".
